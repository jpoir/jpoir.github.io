### My Personal Website

*** IN PROGRESS ***

Just some random html/css/javascript practice I am setting up to showcase some of my personal projects
Going to be adding some react elements soon, but haven't gotten around to it as of Jan. 2020.
Focusing more on back-end solutions currently with other projects that I have been working towards

#### Things to add:
 - Page to PROVE Car
 - Update photos to scale with resizing windows
 - Include digital resume (maybe)
 - Writeup on my goals and job searching
 - React
